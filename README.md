# Student Dashboard - Tableau Project ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Student Dashboard** built in **Tableau** to visualize student performance and cognitive skills.  
It helps educators or analysts quickly understand patterns in student scores, attention, focus, and retention.

## Dataset
The dashboard uses a dataset `student_data.csv` with the following columns:

| student_id | name  | class | comprehension | attention | focus | retention | assessment_score | engagement_time |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Student_1  | Alice | 10A   | 80            | 75       | 70    | 85        | 78              | 120            |

> You can replace this with your own CSV/JSON file with the same structure.
